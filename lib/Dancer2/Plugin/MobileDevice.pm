=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyWebApp;
    use Dancer;
    use Dancer::Plugin::MobileDevice;

    get '/' => sub {
        if (is_mobile_device) {
            # do something for mobile
        }
        else {
            # do something for regular agents
        }
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A plugin for L<Dancer>-powered webapps to easily detect mobile clients and offer
a simplified layout, and/or act in different ways.

The plugin offers a C<is_mobile_device> keyword, which returns true if the
device is recognised as a mobile device.

It can also automatically change the layout used to render views for mobile
clients.

=head1 Custom layout for mobile devices

This plugin can use a custom layout for recognised mobile devices, allowing you
to present a simplified page template for mobile devices.  To enable this, use
the C<mobile_layout> setting for this plugin - for instance, add the following
to your config file:

  plugins:
    MobileDevice:
      mobile_layout: 'mobile'

This means that, when C<template> is called to render a view, if the client is
recognised as a mobile device, the layout named C<mobile> will be used, rather
than whatever the current C<layout> setting is.

You can of course still override this layout by supplying a layout option to the
C<template> call in the usual way (see the L<Dancer> documentation for how to do
this).
