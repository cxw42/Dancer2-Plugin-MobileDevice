# NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::MobileDevice - Make a Dancer2 app mobile-aware

# SYNOPSIS

    package MyWebApp;
    use Dancer2;
    use Dancer2::Plugin::MobileDevice;

    get '/' => sub {
        if (is_mobile_device) {
            # do something for mobile
        }
        else {
            # do something for regular agents
        }
    };

# DESCRIPTION

A plugin for [Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2)-powered webapps to easily detect mobile clients and offer
a simplified layout, and/or act in different ways.

The plugin offers a `is_mobile_device` keyword, which returns true if the
device is recognised as a mobile device.

It can also automatically change the layout used to render views for mobile
clients.

# Custom layout for mobile devices

This plugin can use a custom layout for recognised mobile devices, allowing you
to present a simplified page template for mobile devices.  To enable this, use
the `mobile_layout` setting for this plugin - for instance, add the following
to your config file:

    plugins:
      MobileDevice:
        mobile_layout: 'mobile'

This means that, when `template` is called to render a view, if the client is
recognised as a mobile device, the layout named `mobile` will be used, rather
than whatever the current `layout` setting is.

You can of course still override this layout by supplying a layout option to the
`template` call in the usual way (see the [Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2) documentation for how to do
this).
